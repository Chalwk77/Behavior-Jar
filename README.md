# Behavior-Jar
Behavior Jar app for my daughter


> * Good Behavior: Press the ADD BUTTON to add coins to the jar.
> * Bad Behavior: Press the SUBTRACT BUTTON to remove coins from the jar.

> After reaching a certain coin count (threshold) - either choose to spend some or all of the accumulated coins (to the value of a real world reward) or save them up for a bigger reward at the end of the week.

Coin Count will reset on Monday's at 12am.
